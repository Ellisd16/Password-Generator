![Password](/../Password-Generator\Password.png?raw=true"Password Generator")


For this assignment I tried my best to take the user information given and make a randomly generated password. I while i was successful in making the password, I was unfortunately not able to get the password displayed into the text area. This challenge was a tough one, especially when dealing with the routing of if/else statements. Lucky, I was able to work with my classmates and find solutions to most of the problems I was facing.

In regards to the work done on the file, the first thing I did was identify all the variables that were going to be needed for this algorithm to work. Second, I began with the while statement so that I could continue the loop while being able to validate other requests. Third, I tied the various characters to different if/then statements so that the user could choose between different options. Then, I set up more conditional statements that were based off the users selection, identifying which options had been selected, and which had not. Finally, I plugged the data into a for loop so that I could generate the random password within the given parameters.
